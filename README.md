# Restaurant-Operations-Analysis


Overview

This project focuses on using SQL to analyze a restaurant's operational data following a new menu launch. As the data analyst, my goal was to provide actionable insights into customer behavior and menu performance. By querying and joining the menu_items and order_details tables, I identified key trends to guide future business and menu decisions for "The Taste of the World Café."
Challenge & Approach
The main challenge was to translate raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence. My approach was to use a variety of SQL techniques to explore, aggregate, and connect the datasets to answer specific business questions.
Key Analytical Techniques:
•	Data Exploration: I began by exploring the structure and content of the menu_items and order_details tables to understand their relationships and the scope of the available data.
•	Aggregations & Joins: By using JOIN statements, I connected customer orders to menu item details. I then applied aggregate functions like COUNT, MIN, MAX, and AVG to summarize data, identify top-selling items, and calculate average prices per category.
•	Advanced Queries: I wrote more complex queries to rank customer spending and identify patterns in high-value orders. This allowed for a detailed breakdown of the spending habits of the restaurant's top customers.
Solution & Insights
Through a series of focused queries, I successfully answered the restaurant's key business questions and uncovered several valuable insights:
•	Menu Performance: Italian dishes consistently demonstrated strong popularity, particularly among the highest-spending customers. The analysis also revealed a wide price range within certain menu categories, highlighting opportunities for pricing optimization.
•	Customer Behavior: The highest-value customers showed a tendency to place larger, more diverse orders, making them a crucial group for targeted customer retention strategies.
•	Operational Efficiency: The data provides a solid foundation for understanding customer preferences and can be used to streamline future menu development and marketing campaigns.
Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates my ability to apply a full range of SQL skills—including aggregation, filtering, joins, and ranking—to solve real-world business problems. It highlights my proficiency in transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights that can drive business strategy.
